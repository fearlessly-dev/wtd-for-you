# Accomplishments & Awards

Try to think about accomplishments in 3 contexts:
 * What I did = individual accomplishment
 * How I helped others = team contribution
 * How I built on what others did = strategy + leadership

Bring a sense of self and storytelling. Why was this accomplishment meaningful - to you? to your organization? to your community? to your family? _Accomplishments do not have to be just work related. Activism and community-building are key to highlighting character traits that apply in other contexts_.

**Example:** I'm a parent. How does that unique facet of mine help guide my decision-making or bring fresh perspective to my work? One way is by asking "can I explain this complex technology in a way that my teenager understands it?" - effectively helping ensure that our documentation or content creation projects remain inclusive.
