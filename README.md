# Write The Docs For Me

In Sep 2022, I worked on a talk for an internal presentation to a leadership skills community at Microsoft.
 * The working title: "Write The Docs for Your Personal Brand"
 * The teaser: "If your career was a product, what would your docs look like? And who is your target audience?"
 
The talk and vision were inspired by a few experiences:
 * Building [#30DaysOf](https://github.com/30daysof) projects with Docusaurus, a static site generator
 * Illustrating [#WriteTheDocs 2022](https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums/72177720299222782) talks with sketchnotes
 * Getting familiar with [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) for an [#MSBuild talk](https://nice-field-01ef2cc0f.1.azurestaticapps.net/docs/demo-app/resume-react) to students
 * The [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) philosophy stating code and docs should use _the same tooling_ to be in sync
 * My experiments with [test automation](https://dev.to/nitya/series/15755) and its value to maintaining freshness and correctness of projects

With this project, I want to create a template that mirrors the talk, allowing my audience to instantiate it as a template, customize it for their profiles, and put their personal brand into action.
